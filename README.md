# MATLAB programming module

## Aims
By the end of the module students will be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of MATLAB, including the ability to build and use simple functions to manipulate and display data including:

Explain and describe the workspace, variables, basic mathematical operations, graphs.
Explain flow control (e.g., for loops, if statements) functions.
Describe advanced variables, advanced flow control, file operations.
Explain histograms, box plots, and statistical measures for psychology/neuroimaging data analysis.
