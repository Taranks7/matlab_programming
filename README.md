# MATLAB programming module

## Aims
Matlab programming lectures and homework

Aims and learning objectives The module will introduce students to the MATLAB programming environment so that they can start to make scripts to run experiments, create stimuli, explore datasets, and perform statistical analyses.

The module will cover:

What is MATLAB and why it is useful.
Interacting with MATLAB IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
Basic MATLAB concepts (commands, data structures including vectors and matrices).
Matlab programming techniques (flow control, basic functions, graphics).
Students will complete a structured programming exercise, aimed at making a simple experiment script in MATLAB, which will form the basis of the course assessment.
Learning outcomes By the end of the module students will be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of MATLAB, including the ability to build and use simple functions to manipulate and display data including:

Explain and describe the workspace, variables, basic mathematical operations, graphs.
Explain flow control (e.g., for loops, if statements) functions.
Describe advanced variables, advanced flow control, file operations.
Explain histograms, box plots, and statistical measures for psychology/neuroimaging data analysis.
